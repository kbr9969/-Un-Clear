  1.1- imported image, converted into gray scale using cvtcolor function.
       then used binary thresholding to convert to B/W.
       
  1.2- created video capture object, started a loop which runs when cam is started,
       frames are displayed by that loop which runs fast enough (1000 fps in ideally) for us to percieve motion
       loop breaks when 'Esc' is pressed.
       
  1.3-
